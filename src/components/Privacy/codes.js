### PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE, AND USE

We do not use cookies (or similar technologies) to collect information about you. We collect information you provide directly or indirectly to us, such as when you create or modify your account, request on-demand services, redeem your rewards in our online shop, contact customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. This information may include: name, email, mailing address, age, gender, social media profiles, phone number, and PayPal information. During the registration process, we will also collect information such as your IP address and Google Advertising ID (together, the “ID”).

We will only collect your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy and will not use or otherwise process your information for any other purposes than described below.

If you sign into our Service using a third-party profile, we will import the first name and last name displayed in such profiles, such as information on Facebook or Google, on our platform.

When you use our Services, we will also collect information about how you interact with the games advertised on our platform. The type of information we collect relates to: i) achievements that are unlocked, ii) in-game purchases, iii) other apps on your device, iv) the time you spend playing games, v) the units you’ve earned in Luckmon, and vi) the game experience earned (collectively “User Gaming Profile”). A user’s gaming profile is visible to other users via the chat social networking feature.

We use this information exclusively for the purpose of fraud prevention and to ensure that prizes are not earned through bots, automated processes or fraudulent use of software. Upon redeeming a reward from our Shop, you will be prompted to provide a phone number, which is linked to your user account to ensure the uniqueness of your user registration within the mobile application. If you do not want to redeem a reward from our Shop, you can use all other features of the mobile application without providing your phone number.

For all users 18 years old or above, when redeeming a reward through our Shop, we may verify your face via a ‘video selfie’ using a third party face verification technology. We use this information exclusively for the purpose of fraud prevention and to ensure that prizes are not earned through bots, automated processes or fraudulent use of software.

By using our mobile application and accepting our Privacy Policy, you understand that requesting a reward within the Shop on the Luckmon mobile application will only be possible upon additional user authentication via face verification. Your consent applies to the processing of such biometric data as described below, and is an express acknowledgement that such data is “special category” personal data pursuant to Article 9 of the *General Data Protection Regulation* (GDPR).

We will use your ‘video selfie’ exclusively for fraud prevention. Upon redeeming a reward from our Shop, you will be prompted to provide a video selfie using your mobile device’s camera. This video selfie provides us with a face map (a mathematical representation of your face generated through our third party provider, Facetec). This video selfie is encrypted on your mobile device before being sent to our servers for processing, and is linked to your user account to ensure the uniqueness of your user registration within the mobile application. If you do not want to redeem rewards through the Shop, you can use all other features of the mobile application without providing a video selfie.

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) grants California consumers robust data privacy rights and control over their personal information, including the right to know, the right to delete, and the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information that businesses collect, as well as additional protections for minors. As a consumer, you have the right to request, twice a year and free of charge, certain information about parties to whom we have disclosed or sold your personal information in the prior calendar year and a description of the categories of personal information shared. Additionally, upon request, twice a year and free of charge, we shall provide to you any information relating to your personal information and our processing of your personal information in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form using clear and plain language. To make such a request, please send an email to Privacy@Luckmon.Com and please include the phrase “Personal Information Privacy Request” in the subject line, the Service you are inquiring about, along with your name, address, and email address. You can also ask us to delete your personal data stored on our platform.

We cannot keep a record of individuals whose personal information we have deleted so you may be contacted again by us, should we come into possession of your personal information at a later date. Requests to know and requests to delete will be honored within 45 days; if more time is needed to respond, Luckmon will notify you.

The CCPA enables California users to appoint an authorized agent to act on their behalf to submit disclosure requests and or deletion requests under the CCPA.  The authorized agent must register with the California Secretary of State.  We will honor a request from an authorized agent provided you provide written authorization to the authorized agent to act on your behalf and we can verify your identity and the agent submits proof of authorization.

The following chart contains the categories of personal information, as enumerated in CCPA Sec. 1798.140(o), of personal information we may collect, use, and disclose, the sources of the personal information and our business and commercial uses of such personal information:

| CATEGORY | NAME/DESCRIPTION | SOURCES | BUSINESS USE | COMMERCIAL USE |

### CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT

**Browser “Do Not Track” Signals.**  Most browsers contain a “do-not-track” setting.  In general, when a “do-not-track” setting is active, the user’s browser notifies other websites that the user does not want their personal information and online behavior to be tracked and used, for example, for interest-based advertising.  As required by CalOPPA, we are required to inform you that, as is the case with most websites, we do not honor or alter our behavior when a user to one of our Websites has activated the “do-not-track” setting on her/his browser.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure and may pass through entities that we do not control.

Please make sure you understand how these sites or businesses use and collect your information by reading their privacy statements.

‍

### INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER

We are based in the United States and the information that we process is protected by American privacy laws. The information that we collect may be transferred, stored, or used in other jurisdictions, such as the United States, where some of our service providers may be located. While we protect your information by choosing appropriate service providers and having contractual safeguards in place with those vendors, the privacy laws in such jurisdictions may not be as protective as in, for example, Canada or the EEA, SUI & UK, and may be subject to access by foreign governments, with or without your knowledge.

The information collected in the EEA, SUI & UK is transferred and stored behind firewalls on our secure servers that are located on Amazon AWS in the United States in accordance with the GDPR adequacy standards. Any other transfers to third countries will be done using mechanisms such as the “model clauses”.

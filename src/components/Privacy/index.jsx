PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE, AND USE
</Styled.SubTitle>

We do not use cookies (or similar technologies) to collect information about you. We collect information you provide directly or indirectly to us, such as when you create or modify your account, request on-demand services, redeem your rewards in our online shop, contact customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. This information may include: name, email, mailing address, age, gender, social media profiles, phone number, and PayPal information. During the registration process, we will also collect information such as your IP address and Google Advertising ID (together, the “ID”).
We will only collect your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy and will not use or otherwise process your information for any other purposes than described below.
If you sign into our Service using a third-party profile, we will import the first name and last name displayed in such profiles, such as information on Facebook or Google, on our platform.
When you use our Services, we will also collect information about how you interact with the games advertised on our platform. The type of information we collect relates to: i) achievements that are unlocked, ii) in-game purchases, iii) other apps on your device, iv) the time you spend playing games, v) the units you’ve earned in Luckmon, and vi) the game experience earned (collectively “User Gaming Profile”). A user’s gaming profile is visible to other users via the chat social networking feature.
We use this information exclusively for the purpose of fraud prevention and to ensure that prizes are not earned through bots, automated processes or fraudulent use of software. Upon redeeming a reward from our Shop, you will be prompted to provide a phone number, which is linked to your user account to ensure the uniqueness of your user registration within the mobile application. If you do not want to redeem a reward from our Shop, you can use all other features of the mobile application without providing your phone number.
For all users 18 years old or above, when redeeming a reward through our Shop, we may verify your face via a ‘video selfie’ using a third party face verification technology. We use this information exclusively for the purpose of fraud prevention and to ensure that prizes are not earned through bots, automated processes or fraudulent use of software.
By using our mobile application and accepting our Privacy Policy, you understand that requesting a reward within the Shop on the Luckmon mobile application will only be possible upon additional user authentication via face verification. Your consent applies to the processing of such biometric data as described below, and is an express acknowledgement that such data is “special category” personal data pursuant to Article 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
We will use your ‘video selfie’ exclusively for fraud prevention. Upon redeeming a reward from our Shop, you will be prompted to provide a video selfie using your mobile device’s camera. This video selfie provides us with a face map (a mathematical representation of your face generated through our third party provider, Facetec). This video selfie is encrypted on your mobile device before being sent to our servers for processing, and is linked to your user account to ensure the uniqueness of your user registration within the mobile application. If you do not want to redeem rewards through the Shop, you can use all other features of the mobile application without providing a video selfie.

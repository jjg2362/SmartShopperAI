ACCOUNT & ELIGIBILITY
</Styled.SubTitle>
<Styled.Text>
Some of the Services require that you sign up for a User account. Only one (1) User account may be set up per User. Only users 18 years or older are permitted to register for a User account.

Some of the Services that we provide require that you enable the "Display of Other Apps" option. Enabling this option will allow us to better understand the types of games you prefer to play so that we can suggest to you other similar games. You will receive a notification if you need to enable this option.

Some of our Services that we provide allow for a “Guest” or “Continue as Guest” option allowing restricted access to the Service. We reserve the right to modify restrictions applied to certain features when accessing the Service through a Guest option.

Our App contains a social feature allowing the User to interact with other User(s).

The User may only set up one account in the App. It is prohibited to create multiple accounts or transfer or sell a User account to third parties. You are not allowed to use a virtual private network (“VPN”), proxy or any other means to obscure the true source of traffic when using the Services. You are not allowed to use any other electronic means such as an internet bot or web robot (“Bot”) to generate automated views, clicks or conversions or employing any misleading practices such as repeated manual clicks to artificially inflate user activity and/or revenues when using the Services. Any User activity that uses a VPN, proxy or Bot will be considered as fraudulent activity and will be blocked by our fraud prevention system. The use of a VPN, proxy or Bot can cause your device to be permanently blacklisted and your User account to be either suspended or terminated.

‍

Luckmon reserves the right to indefinitely ban any user found to be using an auto clicker program or any similar software that allows a user to falsify data relating to their phone's input, or that allows them to appear to be using their phone when in reality they have left it idle.

‍

Luckmon reserves the right to indefinitely ban any user found to be accessing the application through an emulator of any kind, regardless of the platform on which the emulator is being used.

‍

Luckmon reserves the right to ban any account associated with software that can be used to modify games, or software that can unlock in-game content for free that would otherwise need to be purchased.

‍

Luckmon reserves the right to ban any account associated with disposable email addresses that automatically forward messages to an alternate address, or that can automatically visit and open verification links that are sent to them.

‍

Luckmon reserves the right to nullify all Gems earned on any account that has been banned, and to disable the redemption of rewards on all banned accounts, regardless of the reason for which the account was banned.

  TERM

REWARDS
</Styled.SubTitle>
<Styled.Text>
Luckmon offers loyalty points, used as virtual currency in the Luckmon apps and referred to as “Gems”, to Users in exchange for testing, reviewing and/or using the mobile games listed in the App. Luckmon does not reward for time spent in App but rather for real gametime. Leaving the App open does not constitute gameplay. Users can redeem Gems for different rewards offered by Luckmon, such as gift cards, gift certificates, prepaid cash cards or content codes (collectively “Rewards”). The Rewards cannot be redeemed for cash or in any way resold, exchanged or returned for a cash refund, unless required by law. Rewards may be redeemed in countries where applicable merchants and services are available. Luckmon is not responsible for any valid Reward which the user is unable to redeem due to their age, situation, or country of residence. Luckmon is not responsible for any lost, stolen, or malfunctioning Rewards except when it is caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct of Luckmon.

For all users 18 years or older, when redeeming a reward through our Shop, we may verify your face via a ‘video selfie’ using a third party face verification technology. We use this information exclusively for the purpose of fraud prevention and to ensure that prizes are not earned through bots, automated processes or fraudulent use of software. We will use your ‘video selfie’ exclusively for fraud prevention. Upon redeeming a reward from our Shop, you will be prompted to provide a video selfie using your mobile device’s camera. This video selfie provides us with a face map (a mathematical representation of your face generated through our third party provider, Facetec). This video selfie is encrypted on your mobile device before being sent to our servers for processing, and is linked to your user account to ensure the uniqueness of your user registration within the mobile application. If you do not want to redeem rewards through the Shop, you can continue to use all other features of the mobile application without providing a video selfie. For more information, please refer to our Privacy Policy available at [Https://Www.Luckmon.Com/Legal/Privacy](https://www.mistplay.com/legal/privacy).

Until October 31, 2021, existing users between the ages of 13 and 17 years old will be required to provide a phone number to verify their account upon redeeming a reward through our Shop. We use this information exclusively for the purpose of fraud prevention and to ensure that prizes are not earned through bots, automated processes or fraudulent use of software. Upon redeeming a reward from our Shop, you will be prompted to provide a phone number, which is linked to your user account to ensure the uniqueness of your user registration within the mobile application. If you do not want to redeem a reward from our Shop, you can use all other features of the mobile application without providing your phone number.
